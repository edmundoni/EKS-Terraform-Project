# EKS-Terraform-Project

CI/CD Kubernetes Pipeline
This project demonstrates a robust CI/CD pipeline designed for Kubernetes-based applications. It incorporates security, code quality, runtime monitoring, infrastructure automation, and containerisation best practices using modern DevOps tools.

Overview
The pipeline includes:

Terraform: Automates the provisioning of an Amazon EKS cluster for Kubernetes workloads.
Trivy: Ensures security by scanning file systems and container images for vulnerabilities.
SonarQube: Performs static code analysis to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
Docker: Builds and hosts containerised applications for deployment.
Kubernetes: Manages and deploys containerised workloads efficiently.
Falco: Monitors runtime behaviour to detect anomalies and potential security threats in Kubernetes clusters.
Highlights
Infrastructure as Code:

Uses Terraform to provision an Amazon EKS cluster, ensuring consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployment.
Security-First Approach:

Vulnerability scanning with Trivy integrated at multiple stages of the pipeline.
Runtime security monitoring with Falco to detect unauthorised or suspicious activity in the cluster.
Code Quality Assurance:

Ensures clean, maintainable, and reliable code using SonarQube.
Seamless Containerisation:

Leverages Docker for consistent and reproducible application builds.
Kubernetes Integration:

Deploys scalable, containerised applications using Kubernetes manifests.
Tools and Technologies
Infrastructure: Terraform, Amazon EKS, AWS
CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar tools (configurable)
Security: Trivy, Falco
Code Quality: SonarQube

Use Cases
This pipeline is ideal for:

Automating infrastructure provisioning and application deployment in cloud-native environments.
Enhancing security and code quality in the software development lifecycle.
Monitoring runtime behaviour for threats and anomalies in Kubernetes clusters.
Demonstrating DevOps expertise in CI/CD pipeline design, infrastructure automation, and runtime security.
